# lettergame.exe

(aka "Same Game for Windows")

Back when Windows 3 was a thing, my Dad used to play and love this game. In time, with software updates, the game disappeared. 

So for father's day this year, I built a web based version for him. It's all in typescript and react.

## Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jakebloom/lettergame.exe.git
$ cd lettergame.exe
$ npm install --dev
$ webpack # this builds the project
```
Then open up `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go!
